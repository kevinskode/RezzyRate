    <!-- Data you provide -->
    <article class="card soft prose">
      <h2>Information you provide</h2>
      <p>When you use Rezzy, you may give us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Resume content</strong> – text you paste or upload so we can score it,
          extract keywords, and suggest improvements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Job descriptions or links</strong> – used to compare your resume against
          specific roles and calculate match scores.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment details (indirectly)</strong> – when you buy credits, payment
          information is processed by our payment provider (for example, Stripe). Rezzy
          never stores your full card number.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support messages</strong> – if you email or contact us, we keep that
          message so we can respond and improve the product.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <!-- Data we automatically collect -->
    <article class="card soft prose">
      <h2>Information we automatically collect</h2>
      <p>To keep Rezzy running reliably and securely, we may log:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Basic usage and device data</strong> – such as browser type, approximate
          region, and pages viewed, mainly for performance and abuse prevention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aggregate metrics</strong> – how often features are used, error rates,
          and anonymized stats that help us decide what to improve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cookies or similar technologies</strong> – used for things like
          remembering limits, handling payments, and, where enabled, measuring traffic
          and ads.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <!-- How we use your data -->
    <article class="card soft prose">
      <h2>How we use your data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To analyze your resume and generate scores, breakdowns, and suggestions.</li>
        <li>To show you job-match insights when you provide a job post or link.</li>
        <li>To run payments, enforce credit limits, and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
        <li>To troubleshoot issues, improve features, and keep Rezzy secure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We don’t use your resume text to train public models or build unrelated products.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- Third-party services -->
    <article class="card soft prose">
      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>Rezzy relies on reputable third-party providers to function, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Payment processing</strong> (e.g., Stripe) to handle card payments safely.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud hosting & infrastructure</strong> to run the app and store limited data.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics & ads</strong> (such as Google services) to understand traffic,
          detect issues, and display ads where applicable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These providers only receive the data necessary to perform their role and are
        not allowed to use it to market their own services to you.
      </p>

    <!-- Retention -->
    <article class="card soft prose">
      <h2>How long we keep things</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Raw resume text</strong> – kept only as long as needed to generate your
          report and operate related features. In many cases it is processed
          temporarily and not stored long-term.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saved results / history</strong> – if we offer an option to save scans,
          those may be stored longer so you can revisit them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment & billing records</strong> – kept as required for accounting,
          tax, and fraud-prevention purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics logs</strong> – stored in aggregate form to understand usage
          and performance trends.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <!-- Your choices / contact -->
    <article class="card soft prose">
