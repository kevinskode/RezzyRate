      <!-- STORY / MISSION -->
      <section class="page-grid about-story">
        <div class="card soft prose">
          <h2>Why Rezzy Rate exists</h2>
          <p>
            Job hunting is already stressful. Between tailoring your resume, decoding job descriptions, and wondering if a human will ever actually read your application, it’s easy to feel stuck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rezzy Rate was created to make that process less confusing and a lot more predictable. Instead of guessing what matters, you get clear, prioritized feedback on the things recruiters and ATS actually pay attention to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of Rezzy Rate as a brutally honest (but kind) hiring manager that sits on your shoulder and says:
            <em>“Here’s what’s strong, here’s what’s weak, and here’s exactly what to fix next.”</em>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card soft prose">
          <h2>What Rezzy Rate looks at</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>ATS keyword coverage</b> – how well your resume lines up with the job description.</li>
            <li><b>Writing quality</b> – clarity, tone, readability, and fluff that can be cut.</li>
            <li><b>Structure & sections</b> – Experience, Education, Skills, and how cleanly they’re organized.</li>
            <li><b>Scanability</b> – bullet structure, use of metrics, and how quickly a recruiter can skim.</li>
            <li><b>Impact statements</b> – whether your bullets sound like “I did stuff” or “I moved the needle.”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You don’t just get a score – you get a roadmap of what to tweak so your next application feels intentional, not random.
          </p>

      <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
      <section class="page-section">
        <div class="card soft prose">
          <h2>How Rezzy Rate works</h2>
          <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>
              <b>Upload or paste your resume</b><br>
              Drop in your PDF, DOCX, or text, or paste your resume directly into the checker.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Optionally add a job description</b><br>
              This lets Rezzy Rate analyze keyword alignment and highlight important gaps for the specific role.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Get an instant breakdown</b><br>
              In a few seconds, you’ll see scores, strengths, and specific suggestions you can apply today.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            No templates to wrestle with. No fluff. Just practical feedback you can use between applying to jobs, during a lunch break, or right before hitting “submit.”
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- WHO IT'S FOR / VALUE -->
      <section class="page-grid about-audience">
        <div class="card soft prose">
          <h2>Who Rezzy Rate is for</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Career starters</b> – students, recent grads, and career changers who want a resume that doesn’t feel generic.</li>
            <li><b>Mid-career pros</b> – people who have solid experience but need help translating it into sharp bullet points.</li>
            <li><b>Job search grinders</b> – anyone firing off lots of applications and wanting a quick sanity check before each one.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card soft prose">
          <h2>What makes it different</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Plain-language feedback</b> – no dense reports, just clear notes you can act on right away.</li>
            <li><b>Built around real recruiter habits</b> – highlights what’s skimmed first, ignored, or overused.</li>
            <li><b>Fast and lightweight</b> – no account creation needed to try it, and you can test small changes quickly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top:0.5rem;">
            The goal isn’t to “game” the system. It’s to help you present your experience in a way that feels sharp, honest, and easy to say “yes” to.

          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <h3>Do I have to be a “tech person” to use Rezzy Rate?</h3>
          <p>
            Not at all. If you can upload a file or paste text, you can use Rezzy Rate. The feedback is written in normal language, not technical jargon.
          </p>

          <h3>Does Rezzy Rate write my resume for me?</h3>
          <p>
            Rezzy Rate doesn’t replace your judgment or your voice. It highlights what’s strong, what’s unclear, and where you can add detail – so you can rewrite your resume in a way that still sounds like you.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I use it for multiple job applications?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Rezzy Rate works best when you tweak your resume for each role. You can run different versions against different job descriptions to see how your alignment improves over time.
          </p>

          <h3>Is Rezzy Rate a guarantee I’ll get interviews?</h3>
          <p>
            No tool can guarantee that. What Rezzy Rate does do is increase your odds by helping you present a clearer, sharper, and more targeted version of your experience.
